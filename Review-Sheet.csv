Each time the door closes, the lift checks to see if there are any floors in the current direction (up or down). If there are, then it services these floors first, starting with the closest one to the current floor. If there are no floors requiring stops in the current directions, it checks the opposite direction, again servicing the floor closest to the current floor. If the lift is not moving (direction STOP), then it services up requests before down requests. Each time, the elevator arrives at a floor, new passengers can get on and request a floor.
